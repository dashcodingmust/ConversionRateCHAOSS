Implement Conversion Rate Metric In Chaoss Software
Organization: CHAOSS
Technologies: python, postgresql, docker, pandas, Augur, Plotly / D3.js
Topics: visualization, developer tools, data analysis, Community Metrics

Open-source projects tend to struggle with retaining contributors after the initial involvement. In this project, a Conversion Rate Metric is proposed for measuring how well newcomers convert into frequent contributors. From these patterns of conversion, communities can enhance onboarding, interaction, and overall contributor experience. The metric will be applied on the CHAOSS/Augur platform, utilizing its infrastructure for data collection and analysis. A stable data pipeline developed using Python and SQL will retrieve contributor activity data from Git repositories and issue trackers. Conversion criteria (e.g., D0 → D1 → D2) will be defined to allow for consistent and meaningful measurement. The project will provide: 1. A conversion rate metric that can be tailored to various needs and incorporated into Augur 2. An automated pipeline for data collection and processing 3. A dashboard with visualizations of conversion trends, cohort analysis, and contributor activity 4. Comprehensive testing on real-world repositories to ensure accuracy 5. Documentation and onboarding materials for maintainers Through giving open-source communities a means to track and analyze contributor conversion, this project will enable data-driven community development and healthier contributor ecosystems. It continues the efforts of CHAOSS to advance contributor metrics and offer actionable insights to maintainers.
